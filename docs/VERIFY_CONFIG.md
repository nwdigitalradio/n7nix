## Verifying CORE Install/Config on UDRC/DRAWS

### Verify image write to micro SD card
* The fact that the micro SD card boots is a good indication that things might be OK
* If you are using a single micro SD card for your RPi and you previously ran *initcfg.sh* on the old image, the following script will verify that your current image is in a **good initial state** after writing the image to the micro SD card.
* This script is just an indication that the __initcfg.sh__ script has successfully run or not.

```
n7nix/config/cfgcheck.sh
```
* If you see the following as the output **before running** _initcfg.sh_ script then your image did not get copied properly.
```
-- app_config.sh core script has ALREADY been run
```
* This is the output from *cfgcheck.sh* you would expect on a new image that has not been configured **yet** with *initcfg.sh* script
```
-- app_config.sh core script has NOT been run: hostname: 1, passwd: 1, logfile: 1
```

### Testing _direwolf_ & the UDRC/DRAWS Hat

* Before testing AX.25/Direwolf functionality be sure they are running.
```
ax25-start
```
* To get more information on AX.25 & Direwolf status, run the following:
```
ax25-status
# or for more verbose output turn on debug:
ax25-status -d
```

* The first few commands assume a direwolf/ax.25 installation
* The _showudrc.sh_ script in the local bin directory executes many of the commands listed below.
  * The copious output of this script will usually show you any installation & configuration anomalies

* The image you are running may NOT have _direwolf_ running from boot.
  * You can verify that _direwolf_ is not running by typing:
```
pidof direwolf
```
  * If this command returns with a number, it will be the process id of _direwolf_.
    * if no number is returned _direwolf_ is not running.

* To start _direwolf_ and AX.25
```
ax25-start
```

#### Test Receive

* Connect a cable from your UDRC/DRAWS hat to your radio.
* Tune your radio to the 2M 1200 baud APRS frequency 144.390 or some frequency known to have packet traffic
  * You should now be able to see the packets decoded by _direwolf_

* Open a console on your pi and type:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/direwolf/direwolf.log
```

* or open another console window & start up a packet spy

```bash
sudo su
listen -a
```

* To list options for the _listen_ command run:
```
man listen
```

#### Test Transmit

* Tune your radio to the 1200 baud APRS frequency: 144.39
```bash
cd
cd n7nix/debug
sudo su
# Test left channel
./btest.sh -P udr0
# Test right channel
./btest.sh -P udr1
# To see all the options available
./btest.sh -h
```

* This will send either a position beacon or a message beacon
with the -p or -m options.

* Using a browser go to: [aprs.fi](https://aprs.fi/)
  * Under Other Views, click on raw packets
  * Put your call sign followed by an asterisk in "Originating callsign"
  * Click search, you should see the beacon you just transmitted.

#### Check status of all AX.25 & _direwolf_ processes started with systemd

* Open another console window to the pi and as user pi type:
```bash
ax25-status -d
```
* After ```== failed & loaded but inactive units ==``` you should see
```
0 loaded units listed.
```

* In your local bin directory(_~/bin_) you can stop and start the entire ax.25/tnc
stack including _direwolf_ with these commands:
  * Since your local bin directory is in your _path_ you may execute the following commands from any directory as a normal user (ie. as user pi)

```bash
ax25-stop
ax25-start
```

* Other progams that confirm that the installation was successful

#### check hardware version of Raspberry Pi & DRAWS Hat

```bash
cd ~/n7nix/bin
./piver.sh
./udrcver.sh
```

#### check ALSA soundcard enumeration & levels

```bash
cd ~/bin
./sndcard.sh
```

#### check ALSA settings for deviation

* Show the left & right audio channel settings

```bash
alsa-show.sh

 ===== ALSA Controls for Radio Tansmit =====
LO Driver Gain  L:[0.00dB]	R:[0.00dB]
PCM	        L:[0.00dB]	R:[0.00dB]
DAC Playback PT	L:[PTM_P3]	R:[PTM_P3]
LO Playback CM	[Full Chip CM]

 ===== ALSA Controls for Radio Receive =====

###### Set output ie. deviation with these controls
* Each of these outputs has its own amplifier
* PCM : digital control
  * output samples are multiplied by a value determined by this control before being sent to the DAC
* LO Driver Gain : Analog control
  * determines the gain of the *ANALOG* output amplifier.

###### Set input with this control
* ADC Level : digital control

#### check A2D converter

```

User ADC 1:             +0.00 V
User ADC 2:             +0.00 V
```

#### Check GPS
* Battery: CR 1220 3V lithium non-rechargeable
* Check status of chronyd daemon
```
systemctl status chronyd
```

* Check how many gps channels (satellites) are active
```
gpsmon
```
* or
```
cgps
```
* or
```
# For Raw NMEA sentences
gpspipe -r

# For GPS binary sentences
gpspipe -R

# For gpsd native data
gpspipe -w
```

#### Check chrony synchronization
* **NOTE:** with just GPS and no Internet time servers it often takes 10 minutes for the chrony server to enter online mode.
* To check if chrony is synchronized, make use of the _tracking_, _sources_, and _sourcestats_ commands.

* Display information about the current time sources that chronyd is accessing.
```
chronyc sources

### Testing AX.25

* Verify AX.25 & _direwolf_ are running by running this command:
```
ax25-status
```
* expect this output

```
Status for direwolf.service: RUNNING and ENABLED
Status for ax25dev.service: RUNNING and ENABLED
Status for ax25dev.path: RUNNING and ENABLED
Status for ax25-mheardd.service: RUNNING and ENABLED
Status for ax25d.service: RUNNING and ENABLED
```
* If you don't see the above then start AX.25 & _direwolf_ like this:
```
cd bin
sudo su
./ax25-start
```

* In a console type:
```bash
netstat --ax25
```
* You should see a list of open listening sockets that looks something like this:
```
Active AX.25 sockets
Dest       Source     Device  State        Vr/Vs    Send-Q  Recv-Q
*          N7NIX-0    ax1     LISTENING    000/000  0       0
*          N7NIX-10   ax1     LISTENING    000/000  0       0
```

* Display AX.25 calls recently heard.
  * Must have connection to radio

```bash
mheard
```
* You should see something like this:
```
