## How to run both 1200 & 9600 baud on a DRAWS Hat

### Introduction

Went through the following iterations:

* Using PulseAudio
* Manually change Direwolf baud rate with a script (speed_switch.sh)
* [Touch Tone baudrate](https://github.com/nwdigitalradio/n7nix/tree/master/baudrate#touch-tone-baudrate-installation-notes)
* [Remotely change baud rate using Direwolf Touch Tone capability](https://github.com/nwdigitalradio/n7nix/tree/master/baudrate/README_TOUCHTONE.md)
* Use both ports of a DRAWS hat to have 1200 & 9600 baud active on a single RF channel.

The remainder of this README is for using both ports of a DRAWS hat.

### Radio configuration

* [Brief notes for a Kenwood TM-V71a](https://github.com/nwdigitalradio/n7nix/tree/master/baudrate/README_TOUCHTONE.md#briefly-for-a-Kenwood-tm-v71a)

### Installation

* run script _both_baud.sh_
