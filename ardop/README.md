#### Running ARDOP with ARIM or PAT

There are two ways to start up ARDOP to be used with another application

#### 1. Start each process in a separate console
* Use this method to debug a broken configuration
  * Allows seeing all debug output at the same time
  * Follow this link: [Run manually with processes in separate consoles](MANUAL_STARTUP.md)

#### 2. Start all processes with Systemd Service Files
* This is the preferred way to start ARDOP
  * automatically starts process from boot
  * Follow this Link: [Run automatically with systemd service files](AUTO_STARTUP.md)

#### Running ARDOP waterfall
* On initial startup piARDOP_GUI will prompt for Host Name & Port number
  * set Host Name: localhost
  * set Port: 8515
